Notes:  | 
  Since we were having issues with members getting the newest Xcode version and compatibility between versions has presented problems, the group discussed developing a web application or moving the platform of the app to Android instead of iOS. The group has decided for now to switch to Android development and if we have time, develop the iOS app in addition.
