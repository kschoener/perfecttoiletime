Notes:  | # Anything covered in the meeting that doesn't fit elsewhere.
  For future - add crowd sourcing feature where any user can apply to add a bathroom - if there's 3 or so applications for the same bathroom, approve the
  addition of the bathroom

  After finishing Android App - make code for android wear app

  add a feature that says if there's a changing table in the bathroom

  For monetizing - have restaurants//businesses market their bathrooms (this would cover server costs)
