Notes:  | 
  We discussed our plans for Sprint 2 with Lucas and told him about the new features we plan on implementing. The group has decided to take the battery and data impact of the app on the device into consideration. One idea is to load only the closest bathrooms when on mobile data. Lucas said that he would like if we finished implementing the features for Sprint 2 by our next meeting, Wednesday, so that we can focus the rest of the time on making the YouTube video.
