  Continued merging branches, discovered more bugs and issues with code.
  Fixed those problems and got the app working for the most part.
  Few more things need to be done before sprint is complete.

  Goals for sprint 4:
    Mark: add facebook sharing
    Juno: front-end adding bathroom ratings/comments page
    Ted: back-end adding bathroom functionality
    Steven: Work on algorithms (improve/fix)
    Kyle: Debugging, working on connecting adding bathroom ratings/comments back-end+front-end
