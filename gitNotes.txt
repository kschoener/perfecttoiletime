To add a version tag:
**only do this for sprints or when we make a feature change
$git tag vX.Y.Z
$git push origin --tags


To merge things from branch y to branch x
$ git checkout x #switch to branch x
$ git merge --no-ff --no-commit y #merge branches, but doesn't commit
**if there are conflicts:
$ git status #shows status of branch
#now resolve the conflicts
**if there are no conflicts (or if all conflicts are resolved):
$ git commit -m '<commit message>' #commit the merge with a message
$ git push #push changes to the repository for everyone to see
